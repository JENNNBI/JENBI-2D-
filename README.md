2D TEST GAME (Failed Parallax Effect)

Hello world! This game was my third attempt to my 2D universe. First one was about grid based game.
Second was also based on grids but it was a tower defens type of game. And here we are at the third attemp but it is fail for me. I would like to share with you or myself as a note.

Basic mechanics and animation  taught me a lot here. Jump, left, right even attack animation was very fun to learn. And i think i nailed it.

As soon as i finished the basics i wanted to change my game looking, i tried to do better then grey background. I did some research and found beautiful parallax effect i watched many video. Even it looks easy, for the short time i couldn't implement. I did leave this for another time. If you want to tell me something about it feel free to contect me!
